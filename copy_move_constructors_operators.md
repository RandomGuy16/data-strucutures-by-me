The provided code snippet defines a class my_hashtable that appears to implement a hash table data structure. Let's break down the functions and their purposes, excluding the add(int key) function and the destructor:

---

1. **Default Constructor: `my_hashtable()`**

This is the default constructor for the my_hashtable class. It initializes a new instance of the hash table. Since the body of the constructor is empty, it does not perform any specific initialization tasks. Typically, you would expect this constructor to set up any necessary data structures (like arrays or linked lists) to hold the hash table entries.

2. **Move Constructor: `my_hashtable(my_hashtable &&) = default;`**

This is a move constructor that allows for the efficient transfer of resources from one my_hashtable instance to another. The = default indicates that the compiler will generate the implementation automatically. This is useful for transferring ownership of resources (like dynamically allocated memory) without copying them, which can improve performance.

3. **Copy Constructor: `my_hashtable(const my_hashtable &) = default;`**

This is a copy constructor that creates a new instance of my_hashtable as a copy of an existing instance. The = default means that the compiler will generate the implementation automatically. This constructor is used when you want to create a new hash table that is a duplicate of an existing one.

4. **Move Assignment Operator: `my_hashtable &operator=(my_hashtable &&) = default;`**

This is a move assignment operator that allows for the assignment of one my_hashtable instance to another, transferring resources from the source to the destination. The = default indicates that the compiler will generate the implementation automatically. This is useful for efficiently reassigning one hash table to another without unnecessary copying.

5. **Copy Assignment Operator: `my_hashtable &operator=(const my_hashtable &) = default;`**

This is a copy assignment operator that allows for the assignment of one my_hashtable instance to another by copying the contents of the source instance. The = default means that the compiler will generate the implementation automatically. This operator is used when you want to copy the contents of one hash table into another.

6. **Destructor: `~my_hashtable();`**

Although you requested to ignore the destructor, it's worth noting that this function is responsible for cleaning up resources when an instance of my_hashtable is destroyed. This typically involves deallocating any dynamically allocated memory or other resources that the hash table may have used.
In summary, the functions in the my_hashtable class provide mechanisms for constructing, copying, moving, and assigning instances of the hash table, allowing for efficient management of resources and ensuring proper behavior when instances are created or destroyed.

In C++, the move constructor, copy constructor, move assignment operator, and copy assignment operator are called in specific situations related to object creation and assignment. Here are examples for each:

1. **Move Constructor**
The move constructor is called when an object is initialized with an rvalue (temporary object) or when an object is explicitly moved using std::move.

Example:
```cpp
my_hashtable createHashTable() {
    my_hashtable ht; // Create a temporary hash table
    return ht;       // Return it (this calls the move constructor)
}

int main() {
    my_hashtable ht1 = createHashTable(); // Move constructor is called here
}
```
In this example, createHashTable returns a temporary my_hashtable object, which is then used to initialize ht1. The move constructor is invoked to transfer the resources from the temporary object to ht1.

2. **Copy Constructor**
The copy constructor is called when an object is initialized with another object of the same type (lvalue).

Example:
```cpp
int main() {
    my_hashtable ht1; // Create an instance of my_hashtable
    my_hashtable ht2 = ht1; // Copy constructor is called here
}
```
In this example, ht2 is initialized as a copy of ht1, which invokes the copy constructor.

3. **Move Assignment Operator**
The move assignment operator is called when an existing object is assigned a new value from an rvalue (temporary object).

Example:
```cpp
int main() {
    my_hashtable ht1; // Create an instance of my_hashtable
    my_hashtable ht2; // Create another instance of my_hashtable
    ht2 = std::move(ht1); // Move assignment operator is called here
}
```
In this example, ht2 is assigned the value of ht1 using std::move, which invokes the move assignment operator. The resources of ht1 are transferred to ht2, and ht1 is left in a valid but unspecified state.

4. **Copy Assignment Operator**
The copy assignment operator is called when an existing object is assigned a new value from another object of the same type (lvalue).

Example:

```cpp
int main() {
    my_hashtable ht1; // Create an instance of my_hashtable
    my_hashtable ht2; // Create another instance of my_hashtable
    ht2 = ht1; // Copy assignment operator is called here
}
```
In this example, ht2 is assigned the value of ht1, which invokes the copy assignment operator.

### Summary
Move Constructor: Called when initializing a new object with a temporary `(rvalue)`.
Copy Constructor: Called when initializing a new object with an existing object `(lvalue)`.
Move Assignment Operator: Called when assigning a temporary `(rvalue)` to an existing object.
Copy Assignment Operator: Called when assigning an existing object `(lvalue)` to another existing object.
These mechanisms are crucial for managing resources efficiently in C++, especially when dealing with dynamic memory or other resources that require careful management.

Yes, if you implement your own move constructor and copy constructor, you can remove the `= default` specifier from the move assignment operator and copy assignment operator. However, you will need to provide your own implementations for those operators as well, because the default implementations generated by the compiler will not be automatically provided if you define any of the special member functions (like constructors or destructors).

### Example

Here's an example of how you might implement the move and copy assignment operators if you have already defined your own move and copy constructors:

```cpp
class my_hashtable {
public:
    my_hashtable(); // Default constructor
    my_hashtable(my_hashtable &&); // Move constructor
    my_hashtable(const my_hashtable &); // Copy constructor
    my_hashtable &operator=(my_hashtable &&); // Move assignment operator
    my_hashtable &operator=(const my_hashtable &); // Copy assignment operator
    ~my_hashtable(); // Destructor

    void add(int key);
    
private:
    // Example member variables (e.g., a pointer to dynamically allocated memory)
    int* data; // Just an example, actual implementation may vary
    size_t size; // Size of the hashtable
};

// Move assignment operator implementation
my_hashtable &my_hashtable::operator=(my_hashtable &&other) {
    if (this != &other) { // Self-assignment check
        // Release any resources held by this object
        delete[] data; // Assuming data is dynamically allocated

        // Transfer ownership of resources from 'other' to 'this'
        data = other.data;
        size = other.size;

        // Leave 'other' in a valid state
        other.data = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
    }
    return *this;
}

// Copy assignment operator implementation
my_hashtable &my_hashtable::operator=(const my_hashtable &other) {
    if (this != &other) { // Self-assignment check
        // Release any resources held by this object
        delete[] data; // Assuming data is dynamically allocated

        // Allocate new memory and copy the data
        size = other.size;
        data = new int[size]; // Allocate new memory
        std::copy(other.data, other.data + size, data); // Copy the data
    }
    return *this;
}
```

### Key Points

1. **Self-Assignment Check**: Always check for self-assignment in assignment operators to avoid issues when an object is assigned to itself.

2. **Resource Management**: Ensure that you properly manage resources (like dynamically allocated memory) in both the move and copy assignment operators. This typically involves releasing any existing resources before taking ownership of new ones.

3. **Leave the Moved-From Object in a Valid State**: In the move assignment operator, after transferring resources, leave the moved-from object in a valid but unspecified state (e.g., setting pointers to `nullptr`).

4. **No Default Implementations**: If you define any of the special member functions (like constructors or destructors), the compiler will not provide default implementations for the others. Therefore, you must implement all of them if you need custom behavior.

By implementing your own move and copy assignment operators, you gain full control over how your class manages resources during assignment operations.
